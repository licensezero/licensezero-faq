## What about tax?

Tax rules about software license sales remain unfortunately complex.  In the United States, for example, some states don't charge any sales tax at all on sales of "canned", non-custom software sold without physical media.  Others tax transactions either from or to their jurisdiction differently, along those dimensions.

In the future, License Zero may offer integration with a tax calculation and reporting service.  On first pass, existing services offer too much of the wrong thing, too little of what's actually needed, and usually too little actual warranty or risk protection to recommend.  For now, then, licensors should handle their own tax reporting, using the [ISO 3166-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2) codes associated with licensors, licensees, and waiver beneficiaries to guide them.
